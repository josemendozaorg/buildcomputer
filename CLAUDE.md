- Purpose-driven recommendations (Gaming, Content Creation, AI Workloads, Student needs)
- Real-time price comparison across online retailers
- Component compatibility validation
- Budget optimization tools
- Location-based store recommendations
- Educational content about PC components

## Current Structure

- `README.md` - Project documentation and overview
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code permissions configuration
- `.git/` - Git repository initialization

## Development Setup

This is a fresh project ready for technology stack selection and initial development. Key decisions needed:

- Frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Backend technology (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Database solution
- Price tracking and API integration strategy
- Deployment platform

## Next Steps

1. Technology stack selection
2. Project structure setup
3. Database schema design for components and compatibility
4. API design for price tracking and recommendations
5. Frontend wireframes and user experience design
