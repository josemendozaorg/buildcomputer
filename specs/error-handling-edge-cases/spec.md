**Status:** Approved
**Created:** 2025-10-26
**Feature Group:** Group 5 (Scenarios 22-24)
**Phase:** 2 of 6

---

## Overview

Provide robust error handling and intelligent user guidance for the AI Conversational Builder to gracefully handle unclear inputs, validate budget constraints, and recover from network failures. This feature ensures users receive helpful, educational feedback when they provide vague responses or encounter errors, maintaining conversation continuity and building user confidence in the system.

### Purpose

Enable the AI Conversational Builder to:

1. **Detect vague input** (12+ patterns) and provide empathetic clarification with suggestion chips
2. **Validate budgets** ($400-$15,000 range) with educational messaging about PC component costs
3. **Recover from network errors** with exponential backoff retry (3 attempts) and graceful degradation

### Stakeholders

- **Primary Users:** All users interacting with the AI Conversational Builder
- **First-time users:** Need extra guidance when providing unclear responses
- **Budget-conscious users:** Need education about realistic PC build costs
- **Users on unstable networks:** Need reliable error recovery

## BDD Scenarios

### Scenario 22: Vague Input Detection and Clarification

**Scenario 22.1: User provides vague response - "idk"**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
And the assistant asks "What will you use your PC for?"
When the user types "idk" and sends the message
Then the system should detect the vague input
And display a clarification message: "I'd love to help! Are you looking for gaming, work, or content creation?"
And show 4 suggestion chips: ["I want a gaming PC", "Help me decide", "I need it for work", "Start over"]
And the message should be added to the conversation history
\`\`\`

**Scenario 22.2: User provides vague response - "something good" (case variation)**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
And the assistant asks "What's your budget for this build?"
When the user types "Something Good" and sends the message
Then the system should detect the vague input (case-insensitive)
And display a clarification message with contextual suggestions
And show 4 suggestion chips: ["Under $1000", "$1000-$2000", "$2000+", "I'm not sure"]
\`\`\`

**Scenario 22.3: User provides 3 consecutive vague responses - escalation**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
And the user has provided 2 consecutive vague responses
When the user types "whatever" as the 3rd vague response
Then the system should detect the escalation threshold
And display an escalation message: "Having trouble? Let me ask specific questions instead"
And show 3 guided prompt chips: ["What will you use the PC for?", "What's your budget range?", "Do you have a preferred brand?"]
And the vague input counter should be at 3
\`\`\`

**Scenario 22.4: User clicks suggestion chip**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user received a clarification message with suggestion chips
And the chips are displayed: ["I want a gaming PC", "Help me decide", "I need it for work", "Start over"]
When the user clicks the "I want a gaming PC" chip
Then the system should auto-fill the input with "I want a gaming PC"
And send the message automatically
And continue the conversation with that response
And reset the vague input counter to 0
\`\`\`

**Scenario 22.5: Empty or whitespace-only input**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
And the assistant is waiting for a response
When the user types " " (only spaces) and sends
Then the system should trim the input
And detect it as vague input (empty after trim)
And display clarification: "I didn't catch that. Could you share a bit more detail?"
And NOT add the empty message to conversation history
And show contextual suggestion chips
\`\`\`

**Scenario 22.6: Vague input patterns - all 12+ patterns detected**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
When the user sends any of these messages:
| Input | Pattern Matched |
| "something good" | vague descriptor |
| "I don't know" | uncertain |
| "idk" | uncertain shorthand|
| "maybe" | uncertain |
| "whatever" | deferring |
| "not sure" | uncertain |
| "dunno" | uncertain |
| "anything" | deferring |
| "up to you" | deferring |
| "doesn't matter" | deferring |
| "" | empty |
| "x" | single character |
Then the system should detect each as vague input
And provide appropriate clarification
\`\`\`

---

### Scenario 23: Budget Validation with Educational Guidance

**Scenario 23.1: User enters budget below minimum ($200)**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
And the assistant asks "What's your budget for this build?"
When the user types "$200" and sends the message
Then the system should validate the budget
And detect $200 is below $400 minimum
And display educational message: "Building a complete PC under $400 is challenging because modern CPUs, motherboards, RAM, and storage alone typically cost $450-500 minimum. I can design builds from $400 to $15,000. What budget works for you?"
And show 6 preset budget chips: ["$400", "$750", "$1000", "$1500", "$3000", "Custom"]
And NOT proceed to build recommendations
\`\`\`

**Scenario 23.2: User enters budget above maximum ($50,000)**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
And the assistant asks about budget
When the user types "$50,000" and sends the message
Then the system should validate the budget
And detect $50,000 is above $15,000 maximum
And display educational message: "Whoa, $50,000 is way beyond typical PC builds! Most high-end systems max out around $5,000-8,000. I work best with budgets up to $15,000. Want to try something in that range?"
And show 6 preset budget chips: ["$400", "$750", "$1000", "$1500", "$3000", "Custom"]
And NOT proceed to build recommendations
\`\`\`

**Scenario 23.3: User enters budget at exact minimum ($400)**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
And the assistant asks about budget
When the user types "$400" and sends the message
Then the system should validate the budget
And accept $400 as VALID (inclusive minimum)
And proceed to next conversation step
And store budget in conversation state
\`\`\`

**Scenario 23.4: User enters budget at exact maximum ($15,000)**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
And the assistant asks about budget
When the user types "$15,000" and sends the message
Then the system should validate the budget
And accept $15,000 as VALID (inclusive maximum)
And proceed to next conversation step
And store budget in conversation state
\`\`\`

**Scenario 23.5: User enters budget in various formats**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
And the assistant asks about budget
When the user types any of these formats:
| Input | Parsed Value |
| "$1000" | 1000 |
| "1000" | 1000 |
| "1k" | 1000 |
| "$1,000" | 1000 |
| "2.5k" | 2500 |
| "$5000.00" | 5000 |
Then the system should parse the budget correctly
And validate against the $400-$15,000 range
And proceed if valid
\`\`\`

**Scenario 23.6: User clicks preset budget chip**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user received a budget validation message
And preset chips are shown: ["$400", "$750", "$1000", "$1500", "$3000", "Custom"]
When the user clicks the "$1500" chip
Then the system should set budget to $1500
And proceed to next conversation step
And NOT show validation error (preset values are always valid)
\`\`\`

**Scenario 23.7: User enters budget just outside range ($399, $15,001)**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
When the user enters "$399"
Then the system should show low budget validation message

When the user enters "$15,001"
Then the system should show high budget validation message
\`\`\`

---

### Scenario 24: Network Error Handling with Retry

**Scenario 24.1: Network error on first attempt - successful retry**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user is in AI conversational mode
And the user sends a message "I want a gaming PC"
When the network request fails (timeout or 500 error)
Then the system should catch the error
And display an inline error message: "Hmm, that didn't work! No worries, let's give it another shot."
And show a "Retry (1/3)" button
And preserve the conversation state in localStorage
And the user's message should remain in the conversation history
And NOT show the assistant's response yet
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.2: User clicks retry button - exponential backoff**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given a network error occurred
And the error message shows "Retry (1/3)" button
When the user clicks the "Retry (1/3)" button
Then the system should disable the retry button
And wait 1 second (Â±25% jitter) = 0.75-1.25s
And retry the request
And if successful, display the assistant's response
And hide the error message (or mark as resolved)
And enable interaction again
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.3: Retry fails - increment attempt counter**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user clicked "Retry (1/3)"
When the retry request also fails
Then the system should increment the attempt counter
And display updated error message
And show "Retry (2/3)" button
And wait for user to click retry again
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.4: Second retry with 2-second delay**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the first retry failed
And the error message shows "Retry (2/3)" button
When the user clicks "Retry (2/3)"
Then the system should disable the retry button
And wait 2 seconds (Â±25% jitter) = 1.5-2.5s
And retry the request
And if successful, continue normally
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.5: Third and final retry with 4-second delay**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the second retry failed
And the error message shows "Retry (3/3)" button
When the user clicks "Retry (3/3)"
Then the system should disable the retry button
And wait 4 seconds (Â±25% jitter) = 3-5s
And retry the request
And if successful, continue normally
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.6: All 3 retries fail - show fallback options**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given all 3 retry attempts have failed
When the 3rd retry completes with error
Then the system should hide the retry button
And display a dual CTA error message
And show primary button: "Switch to Persona Mode" (blue, prominent)
And show secondary link: "Report Issue" (text link, subtle)
And preserve all conversation history in localStorage
And the user should be able to click either option
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.7: User clicks "Switch to Persona Mode" after retries exhausted**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given all 3 retries failed
And the dual CTA is displayed
When the user clicks "Switch to Persona Mode"
Then the system should navigate to /build page
And restore conversation state from localStorage
And if budget was specified, pre-populate the budget slider
And if persona was selected, highlight that persona
And show a message: "Welcome back! Let's continue building your PC."
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.8: User clicks "Report Issue"**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given all 3 retries failed
And the dual CTA is displayed
When the user clicks "Report Issue"
Then the system should open an issue report modal/form
And pre-populate error details (error type, timestamp, attempt count)
And include last 5 conversation messages for context
And NOT include sensitive data (no PII)
And allow user to add additional description
And submit to error logging (console.error for now)
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.9: Conversation state preserved during errors**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user has a conversation history with 10 messages
And persona is "Gaming Enthusiast" (if selected)
And budget is $1500 (if specified)
When a network error occurs
Then all conversation state should be preserved in localStorage
And conversation history should contain all 10 messages
And persona should remain "Gaming Enthusiast"
And budget should remain $1500

When the user refreshes the page
Then the conversation state should be restored
And all 10 messages should be displayed
And persona and budget should be restored
And the error state should be displayed
And retry button should be available
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.10: User navigates away during retry**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given the user clicked "Retry (1/3)"
And the system is waiting (exponential backoff delay)
When the user navigates to another page (e.g., clicks browser back)
Then the retry state should be stored in localStorage
And the pending request should be cancelled

When the user returns to /build page
Then the conversation state should be restored
And the error message should be displayed
And the retry counter should be preserved (still at "Retry (1/3)")
And the user can click retry again to resume
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.11: Error messages remain in chat history after resolution**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given a network error occurred
And the error message is displayed in chat
When the user successfully retries
And the assistant responds normally
Then the error message should remain in chat history
And the error message should be visually marked as resolved (faded or strikethrough)
And a hover tooltip should show: "This error was resolved"
And the retry button should be hidden
And the conversation should continue normally
\`\`\`

**Scenario 24.12: Disable retry button while request pending**

\`\`\`gherkin
Given a network error occurred
And the "Retry (1/3)" button is displayed
When the user clicks the retry button
Then the button should be disabled immediately
And the button text should change to "Retrying..." or show a spinner
And the user should NOT be able to click it again
And the button should remain disabled during exponential backoff delay
And the button should remain disabled during the request

When the request completes (success or failure)
Then the button should be re-enabled (if more attempts remain)
Or hidden (if success)
Or updated to next attempt (if failure)
\`\`\`

---

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints

1. **LocalStorage Quota: 5-10MB**
   - LRU cache keeps last 50 messages (~500KB total)
   - Monitor usage at >80% full
   - Graceful degradation if quota exceeded

2. **Exponential Backoff Max Wait: 8.75s**
   - 3 attempts with jitter: 0.75-1.25s + 1.5-2.5s + 3-5s
   - Users tolerate up to 10s wait (within acceptable range)

3. **ChatInterface Compatibility**
   - Must extend existing Message interface (not replace)
