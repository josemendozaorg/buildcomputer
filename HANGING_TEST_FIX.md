# Hanging Test Issue - Fixed

## Problem

Background test processes were hanging indefinitely and never completing.

### Root Cause

Playwright's HTML reporter was configured to automatically serve the report after test completion:

```
Serving HTML report at http://localhost:9323. Press Ctrl+C to quit.
```

This caused tests to wait indefinitely for manual termination, preventing automated test runs from completing.

### Affected Commands

- `pnpm test:e2e` - E2E tests with Playwright
- `pnpm test:bdd` - BDD tests with Playwright
- `pnpm test:all` - Sequential test execution

### Impact

- Tests appeared to hang after completion
- CI/CD pipelines would timeout
- Automated health checks couldn't complete
- Background processes accumulated

## Solution

### Configuration Changes

Updated both Playwright config files to use non-blocking reporters:

**playwright.config.ts** (BDD tests):

```typescript
reporter: [["html", { open: "never" }], ["list"]],
```

**playwright-e2e.config.ts** (E2E tests):

```typescript
reporter: [["html", { open: "never" }], ["list"]],
```

### What Changed

1. **HTML Reporter**: `{ open: "never" }` - Generate HTML report but don't serve it
2. **List Reporter**: Added as secondary reporter for console output
3. **Process Completion**: Tests now exit cleanly after completion

### Benefits

- ✅ Tests complete and exit automatically
- ✅ HTML reports still generated (can be viewed with `pnpm exec playwright show-report`)
- ✅ Console output shows test progress (list reporter)
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines can run without hanging
- ✅ No manual intervention required

## Verification

Test that processes complete:

```bash
# Should complete and exit cleanly
pnpm test:e2e

# Should complete and exit cleanly
pnpm test:bdd

# Should complete entire test suite
pnpm test:all
```

## Viewing Reports

To view the HTML report after tests complete:

```bash
# For E2E tests
pnpm exec playwright show-report

# For BDD tests
pnpm exec playwright show-report
```

This opens the report in your browser without blocking the test process.

## Additional Cleanup

Killed long-running background processes from previous sessions:

- ❌ Background Bash 92cf04 (pnpm test) - Killed
- ❌ Background Bash 6c5a81 (retry tests) - Completed
- ❌ Background Bash 547cc1 (conversationService tests) - Killed
- ❌ Background Bash 9948a0 (pnpm dev) - Killed
- ❌ Background Bash f226dc (pnpm test:e2e) - Completed after showing results

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - Tests now complete cleanly without hanging.
