# Specification: Project Setup and Landing Page

## Overview
### Purpose
This feature establishes the foundational development environment for the BuildComputer project and validates the setup through a minimal, functional landing page.

**Why is this needed?**
- **Cold Start Problem:** The project currently has no code, tooling, or infrastructure
- **Development Velocity:** Without proper setup, development will be slow and error-prone
- **Quality Assurance:** Establishes full test automation from day one (unit, component, E2E, BDD)
- **AI-Friendly Architecture:** Creates clear patterns and structures that AI coding tools can understand and work with effectively
- **Validation:** A working landing page proves the entire stack works correctly before building complex features

**What problem does it solve?**
- Eliminates technical debt by starting with best practices
- Provides instant feedback through hot reload and fast testing
- Ensures maintainability through strict TypeScript and comprehensive tests
- Creates a repeatable pattern for building UI components with Storybook
- Enables rapid deployment through simple build configuration

### Stakeholders
- **Solo Developer:** Primary user of the development environment, needs simplicity and productivity
- **End Users:** Will interact with the landing page, need responsive design and accessibility
- **AI Coding Assistants (Claude Code, Cursor):** Work with the codebase, need clear TypeScript patterns
- **Future Developers:** May contribute or maintain the project, need readable and well-tested code
- **CI/CD Systems:** Automate testing and deployment, need reliable build scripts
- **Deployment Platforms (Vercel/Netlify):** Host the application, need correct build configuration

### User Interactions

#### Developer Interactions
1. **Project Initialization:** Developer runs setup commands to install dependencies and start dev server
2. **Development Workflow:** Developer writes code, sees instant updates via HMR, runs tests with watch mode
3. **Code Quality:** Pre-commit hooks automatically format and lint code before commits
4. **Testing:** Developer runs unit tests, component tests in Storybook, E2E tests, and BDD tests
5. **Build & Deploy:** Developer runs build command, verifies output, deploys to hosting platform

#### End User Interactions (Landing Page)
1. **Page Load:** User visits the landing page and sees content within 1.5 seconds (FCP)
2. **Reading Content:** User reads the hero title, tagline, and description
3. **Call-to-Action:** User hovers over "Get Started" button, sees hover state, clicks button (no navigation yet)
4. **Responsive Experience:** User views page on mobile device, sees mobile-optimized layout
5. **Keyboard Navigation:** User navigates with Tab key, sees focus indicators, activates button with Enter
6. **Screen Reader:** Visually impaired user uses screen reader, hears proper semantic structure and labels
7. **Footer Navigation:** User views footer links (non-functional in this phase)

**Then** the test suite should execute and report failures
**And** failing test output should show expected vs actual values
**And** the command should exit with non-zero status
**And** CI/CD pipeline (if configured) should block deployment

### Scenario 18: Accessibility Violations Detected in Storybook (Edge Case)
**Given** a component story is open in Storybook
