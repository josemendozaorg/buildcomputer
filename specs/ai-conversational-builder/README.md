## Quick Summary

### What We're Building

An AI-powered conversational interface that:

- Guides users through PC building with natural language interaction
- Provides real-time educational content (explanations, comparisons, reasoning)
- Integrates seamlessly with existing persona-based system
- Offers smooth, modern UI with excellent accessibility
- Maintains 100% test coverage and production quality

### Key Features Proposed

1. **Hybrid Interaction Model**
   - Keep existing persona cards for quick starts
   - Add conversational AI mode for guided building
   - Users can switch between modes anytime

2. **Educational Features**
   - Component explanations (tooltips, popovers)
   - "Why this choice?" reasoning for recommendations
   - Real-time guidance and compatibility warnings
   - Progressive disclosure (basic → advanced)

3. **Conversational Flow**
   - Guided prompts with natural language fallback
   - Quick-reply chips for common answers
   - Free-form text input for specific needs
   - 3-10 message flow to complete needs assessment

4. **Enhanced Product Database**
   - Extended with AI context (descriptions, pros/cons, alternatives)
   - Performance tiers and use case tags
   - Compatibility notes
   - Ready for future API integration

5. **Modern UI/UX**
   - Side-by-side layout (chat + build preview) on desktop
   - Full-screen chat on mobile
   - Smooth animations (typing indicators, transitions)
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### Technical Approach (Recommended)

- **AI Service:** Mock AI for Phase 1 (scripted responses), real API in Phase 2
- **State Management:** React hooks + context for conversation state
- **Testing:** BDD scenarios for all conversation flows
- **Components:** Reusable chat components, educational tooltips, guided prompt chips

## Next Steps

1. **User reviews and approves:** requirements-clarification.md (answers 10 questions)
2. **Phase 2 - Spec:** Create comprehensive BDD specifications
3. **Phase 3 - Design:** Technical architecture and component design
4. **Phase 4 - Implement:** TDD implementation with parallel testing
5. **Phase 5 - Verify:** Quality checks and test validation
6. **Phase 6 - PR:** Create pull request and merge

## Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1 (Define):** 10 minutes ✓ (Current phase)
- **Phase 2 (Spec):** 15-20 minutes
- **Phase 3 (Design):** 20-30 minutes
- **Phase 4 (Implement):** 30-60 minutes
- **Phase 5 (Verify):** 3-5 minutes
- **Phase 6 (PR):** 2-3 minutes

**Total:** 70-120 minutes for complete feature

## Success Criteria

- All existing tests continue to pass
- 15+ new BDD scenarios covering conversational flows
- 100% test coverage maintained
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Production-ready code quality
