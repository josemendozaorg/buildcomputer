Feature: AI Conversational Builder

  As a PC builder
  I want to use AI-powered conversational interface to build a custom PC
  So that I can get personalized recommendations with educational guidance

  Background:
    Given the BuildComputer application is running
    And the AI conversational builder feature is enabled

  # ==========================================
  # Group 1: Hybrid Interaction Model
  # ==========================================

  @acceptance @ai @hybrid-mode
  Scenario: User starts with AI chat mode
    Given user is on the builder page
    When user clicks "Talk to AI Builder" button
    Then chat interface should open with greeting message
    And AI should ask first question about use case
    And quick-reply chips should be visible

  @acceptance @ai @hybrid-mode @persona-preservation
  Scenario: User starts with persona selection (existing flow)
    Given user is on the builder page
    When user clicks a persona card
    Then budget slider should appear
    And build recommendations should generate
    And "Talk to AI Builder" option should still be available

  @acceptance @ai @mode-switching
  Scenario: User switches from persona to AI mode
    Given user has selected a persona and sees build recommendations
    When user clicks "Refine with AI" button
    Then chat interface should open
    And AI should acknowledge current selection
    And AI should ask how to refine the build

  @acceptance @ai @mode-switching
  Scenario: User switches from AI mode to persona selection
    Given user is in the middle of AI conversation
    When user clicks "Quick Select Persona" button
    Then persona cards should be displayed
    And conversation progress should be saved
    And user can return to conversation if needed

  @acceptance @ai @smart-suggestions
  Scenario: AI suggests persona during conversation
    Given user is conversing with AI about requirements
    When AI determines user matches "Competitive Gamer" persona
    Then AI should suggest "You sound like a competitive gamer! Want to see optimized builds?"
    And provide quick-reply chip to accept suggestion
    And provide option to continue custom conversation

  # ==========================================
  # Group 2: Conversational Flow with Quick-Reply Chips
  # ==========================================

  @acceptance @ai @conversation-flow
  Scenario: Complete conversation using only quick-reply chips
    Given user starts AI conversation
    When user selects quick-reply chips for all questions
    Then conversation should complete in 6-10 messages
    And AI should gather: use case, specific needs, budget range
    And build recommendations should be generated
    And conversation should feel natural and friendly

  @acceptance @ai @conversation-flow @mixed-input
  Scenario: Mixed input - chips and text
    Given user is in AI conversation
    When user selects a chip for question 1
    And types free-form text for question 2
    And selects chip for question 3
    Then AI should handle both input types seamlessly
    And responses should acknowledge user's specific text input
    And conversation flow should remain coherent

  @acceptance @ai @conversation-flow @text-input
  Scenario: Text-only conversation
    Given user starts AI conversation
    When user types free-form responses to all questions
    Then AI should parse responses intelligently
    And extract use case, budget, and preferences
    And ask clarifying questions when needed
    And complete conversation in 6-10 messages

  @acceptance @ai @context-awareness
  Scenario: AI remembers context from previous messages
    Given user mentions "I play Valorant competitively" in message 2
    When AI asks about graphics needs in message 4
    Then AI should reference Valorant context
    And response should be like "For Valorant, you'll want high FPS. What's your target?"
    And build recommendations should prioritize high refresh rate

  @acceptance @ai @conversation-controls
  Scenario: User can restart conversation
    Given user is halfway through AI conversation
    When user clicks "Start Over" button
    Then conversation should reset
    And chat history should clear
    And AI should greet user again
    And build preview should reset to empty state

  @acceptance @ai @state-persistence
  Scenario: Conversation saves state on navigation
    Given user is in the middle of AI conversation (message 4 of 8)
    When user navigates to home page
    And returns to builder page
    Then conversation should resume from message 4
    And AI context should be preserved
    And build preview should show current state
