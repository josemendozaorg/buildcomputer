# Feature Brief: Group 6 - Accessibility & Performance

## Overview

Implement comprehensive accessibility features and performance optimizations for the AI Conversational Builder chat interface to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and smooth user experience at 60fps.

## Feature Name

Group 6: Accessibility & Performance (Scenarios 25-27)

## Problem Statement

The current AI chat interface lacks:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Users cannot navigate the chat interface using keyboard alone
2. **Screen Reader Support**: Visually impaired users cannot access AI responses effectively
3. **Performance Optimization**: No optimization for large conversations (potential jank/lag)

These gaps prevent:

- Keyboard-only users from using the AI builder
- Screen reader users from understanding AI responses
- Smooth experience as conversations grow longer

## User Stories

### Scenario 25: Keyboard Navigation in Chat

**As a** keyboard-only user  
**I want to** navigate the chat interface using only keyboard  
**So that** I can use the AI builder without a mouse

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Tab key moves focus through: quick-reply chips → text input → send button
- Enter key selects focused chip or sends message
- Escape key closes popovers/tooltips
- Focus indicators are clearly visible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible

### Scenario 26: Screen Reader Announcements

**As a** screen reader user  
**I want to** hear AI responses announced automatically  
**So that** I can follow the conversation without manually navigating

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- New AI messages announced via aria-live region
- Announcements include: "AI says: [message text]"
- Typing indicator announces: "AI is typing"
- All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels
- Quick-reply chips have descriptive labels
- Error/warning messages are announced with context

### Scenario 27: Smooth Animations and Performance

**As a** user with long conversations  
**I want to** experience smooth animations without lag  
**So that** the chat feels responsive even with 50+ messages

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AI typing indicator runs at 60fps
- Message transitions are smooth (no jank)
- Educational tooltips appear within 100ms
- Quick-reply chip hover states are instant (<16ms)
- Virtual scrolling for conversations >50 messages
- React.memo optimization for message components

## Technical Context

### Current Implementation

- ChatInterface component: `/home/dev/repos/buildcomputer/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`
- Currently has basic aria-live region (line 635) but incomplete
- No keyboard navigation handlers
- No performance optimizations for large lists
- No ARIA labels on interactive elements

### Existing Features to Preserve

- Message history with role-based styling
- Quick-reply chips (3-level priority)
- Error/warning message display with icons
- Start Over and Quick Select Persona buttons

## Scope

### In Scope

1. **Keyboard Navigation System**
   - Tab order management
   - Enter/Escape key handlers
   - Focus trap in popovers
   - Visible focus indicators

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Comprehensive ARIA labels
   - aria-live polite announcements
   - Status announcements (typing indicator)
   - Semantic HTML structure

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - React.memo for Message components
   - Virtual scrolling with react-window
   - Debounced scroll handlers
   - requestAnimationFrame for animations

### Out of Scope

- Voice control (future enhancement)
- Custom screen reader voices
- Performance optimization for other pages
- Internationalization (i18n)

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- react-window (for virtual scrolling)
- @testing-library/react (for accessibility tests)
- axe-core (for automated a11y testing)
- Playwright (for E2E keyboard/screen reader tests)

### Feature Dependencies

- Groups 1-5 already implemented (foundation complete)
- ChatInterface component exists
- Message type definition exists

## Success Metrics

### Accessibility Compliance

- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (axe-core: 0 violations)
- ✅ All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- ✅ All dynamic content announced to screen readers
- ✅ Focus indicators meet 3:1 contrast ratio

### Performance Metrics

- ✅ 60fps animations (measured with Chrome DevTools)
- ✅ <100ms tooltip appearance
- ✅ <16ms hover state response
- ✅ Smooth scrolling with 100+ messages
- ✅ <500ms initial render for 50 messages

### Test Coverage

- ✅ 100% unit test coverage for new functions
- ✅ BDD scenarios 25-27 passing
- ✅ E2E tests with keyboard-only interaction
- ✅ E2E tests with screen reader assertions

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1: Define** - 5-10 minutes ✅ (Complete)
- **Phase 2: Spec** - 15-20 minutes (BDD scenarios + acceptance criteria)
- **Phase 3: Design** - 20-30 minutes (Technical architecture)
- **Phase 4: Implement** - 40-60 minutes (Parallel TDD)
- **Phase 5: Verify** - 3-5 minutes (Quality checks)
- **Phase 6: PR** - 2-3 minutes (PR creation)

**Total: 85-130 minutes**

## Assumptions

1. **Keyboard Navigation:**
   - Standard Tab/Enter/Escape behavior is acceptable
   - Focus trap only needed for modal popovers (not main chat)
   - Arrow keys NOT needed for chip navigation (Tab is sufficient)

2. **Screen Reader:**
   - "polite" aria-live is appropriate (not "assertive")
   - Announcements should be natural language (not verbose)
   - Existing semantic HTML structure is mostly correct

3. **Performance:**
   - Virtual scrolling threshold: 50+ messages
   - 60fps is the target (matches browser refresh rate)
   - React.memo sufficient (no need for useMemo/useCallback on all functions)

4. **Browser Support:**
   - Modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)
   - No IE11 support required
   - Screen reader testing: NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (macOS)

## Open Questions

**NONE** - Proceeding with assumptions above. User can clarify if needed.

## Notes

- This is the final group (Group 6) of AI Conversational Builder Phase 2
- All previous groups (1-5) are implemented and merged
- Focus on production-ready quality with comprehensive testing
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is mandatory (not optional)
