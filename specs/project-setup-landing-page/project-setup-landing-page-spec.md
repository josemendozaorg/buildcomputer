# Specification: Project Setup and Landing Page

## Overview
### Purpose
This feature establishes the foundational development environment for the BuildComputer project and validates the setup through a minimal, functional landing page.

**Why is this needed?**
- **Cold Start Problem:** The project currently has no code, tooling, or infrastructure
- **Development Velocity:** Without proper setup, development will be slow and error-prone
- **Quality Assurance:** Establishes full test automation from day one (unit, component, E2E, BDD)
- **AI-Friendly Architecture:** Creates clear patterns and structures that AI coding tools can understand and work with effectively
- **Validation:** A working landing page proves the entire stack works correctly before building complex features

**What problem does it solve?**
- Eliminates technical debt by starting with best practices
- Provides instant feedback through hot reload and fast testing
- Ensures maintainability through strict TypeScript and comprehensive tests
- Creates a repeatable pattern for building UI components with Storybook
- Enables rapid deployment through simple build configuration

### Stakeholders
- **Solo Developer:** Primary user of the development environment, needs simplicity and productivity
- **End Users:** Will interact with the landing page, need responsive design and accessibility
- **AI Coding Assistants (Claude Code, Cursor):** Work with the codebase, need clear TypeScript patterns
- **Future Developers:** May contribute or maintain the project, need readable and well-tested code
- **CI/CD Systems:** Automate testing and deployment, need reliable build scripts
- **Deployment Platforms (Vercel/Netlify):** Host the application, need correct build configuration
