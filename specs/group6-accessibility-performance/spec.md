## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints

- Must use react-window for virtual scrolling (proven library)
- Must use CSS animations for 60fps performance (GPU-accelerated)
- Must maintain existing ChatInterface API (no breaking changes)
- Must work in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions)

### Assumptions

- Standard Tab/Enter/Escape behavior is acceptable (no custom keyboard shortcuts)
- "polite" aria-live is appropriate (not "assertive" which interrupts screen readers)
- 50+ messages is reasonable threshold for virtual scrolling
- React.memo is sufficient for optimization (no need for useMemo/useCallback everywhere)
- Existing semantic HTML structure is mostly correct

### Dependencies

- react-window (virtual scrolling) - to be installed
- @testing-library/react (accessibility tests) - already installed
- axe-core (automated a11y testing) - already in Playwright
- Playwright (E2E keyboard/screen reader tests) - already installed

## Open Questions

**NONE** - All requirements are clear and assumptions documented above.

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests

- **Keyboard event handlers:** Tab, Enter, Escape key handling
- **ARIA label generation:** Proper announcement text formatting
- **Performance utilities:** React.memo implementation
- **Coverage target:** 95% for new utilities

### Integration Tests

- **Keyboard navigation flow:** End-to-end tab order verification
- **Screen reader announcements:** aria-live region updates
- **Message rendering:** React.memo prevents re-renders
- **Coverage target:** 90% for component integration

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

- **Keyboard-only navigation:** Complete chat flow without mouse
- **Screen reader simulation:** Verify aria-live announcements
- **Performance benchmarks:** 60fps verification with DevTools
- **axe-core scans:** 0 accessibility violations

### BDD Tests (QuickPickle)
